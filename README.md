# Internal `CCAS` Resources

These are internal resources for the `CCAS` class.
They are meant to be available to teachers and trainers, but not to students and trainees.
Resources are mostly evaluation items: assignment reference solutions, exam papers, graded quiz questions.

Each type of content is located in their corresponding directory.
